# Overview

This repository contains the code used in the analysis of data associated with the manuscript titled Inter-laboratory ring test for environmental DNA extraction protocols: implications for marine megafauna detection using three novel qPCR assays. The code is used to analyze total DNA quantification via Qubit, species-specific qPCR data, and statistical comparisons between different DNA extraction techniques across multiple labs. 

# Data Availability 

The dataset used in this study, including qPCR Ct values, total DNA concentrations, and metadata, is publicly available via the supplementary information of the associated publication.
